# Airbnb Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

---

## **Project Description**
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the price of Airbnb listings. Pricing an Airbnb property correctly is crucial for both hosts and travelers: hosts want to maximize occupancy and earnings, while travelers want fair and competitive prices. Using historical Airbnb data, the project develops a regression model that learns relationships between listing attributes (such as number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and guest ratings) and the price charged.
